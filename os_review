Difference between library call and system call

Library Call:
------------
If possible make a library call, it is just a cost of calling subroutine 

System Call:
------------
Trap into the operating system 
10 times more expensive 

Does this things potentially affect any other processes?
If we need to coordiate with other processes it needs to be a system call.
If it is only going to affect current process it doesnot need to be
a system call.
