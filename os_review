Difference between library call and system call

Library Call:
------------
If possible make a library call, it is just a cost of calling subroutine 

System Call:
------------
Trap into the operating system 
10 times more expensive 

Does this things potentially affect any other processes?
If we need to coordiate with other processes it needs to be a system call.
If it is only going to affect current process it doesnot need to be
a system call.

For Example
-----------
String concatination doesnot need to be system call. There is no other processes in the system care you
are concatinating strings together. It is done using library call.

If we read data from file we need to coordinate to process potentially 
writing data to the same file. In particular, We want to ensure automacity of system call.
There is a porcess attempting to write to the file and you are trying to read the same part 
of the same file. The promise the system has to make is either you see before the file
write started or you see after the write completed. You donot see the file half written.
