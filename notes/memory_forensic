Systems Overview
================
-- overview of the operating system structures and hardware components that affect memory analysis

Digital Environment
*******************
-- The underlying hardware ultimately dictates the constraints of what a particular system can do
-- The underlying hardware specifies the instructions that can be executed and the resources that can be accessed
-- Investigators who can identify the unique hardware components of a system and the impact those components 
can have on analysis are the best position to conduct an effective investigation

-- On most platforms, the hardware is accessed through a layer of software called an operating system, which controls
1. processing
2. manages resources
3. facilitates communication with external devices

-- OS must deal with the low-level details of the particular processor, devices, and memory hardware installed in a 
given system
-- typically, OS also implements a set of high-level services and interfaces that define how the hardware can be accessed 
by the user's programs
-- During investigation, we look for artifacts that suspected software or users might have introduced 
into the digital environment try to determine how the digital environment changed in response to those artifacts
-- A digital investigator's familiarity with a system's hardware and operating system provide a valuable frame of 
reference during analysis and event reconstruction
