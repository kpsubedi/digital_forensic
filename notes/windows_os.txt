[The Boot Process]
In very general terms, the Windows boot process begins with the boot manager being loaded into memory and executed. 
However, the exact nature of this sequence of events depends upon the type of firmware installed on the motherboard:
1. Is it a tried-and-true PC basic input/output system (BIOS)?
2. or is it one of these new-fangled extensible firmware interface (EFI) deals?
