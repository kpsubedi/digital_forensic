Linux Security Model
====================
Accounts: superuser(root), system accounts( mail, apache, bin, uucp etc), and normal user accounts


#ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow

#chmod 644 sample.txt
#chmod u+rw,g+r,o+r sample.txt

#chown test.test sample.txt

In addition to read, write, and execute permissions. *NIX also has 
1. set UID i.e. SUID
2. set GID i.e SGID
3. Sticky BIT 

SUID
****
When SUID permission is set on an executable file, a process that runs this file is granted access based 
on the owner of the file (usally root), instead of the user who is executing. 
null@null-VirtualBox:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 54256 Mar 29  2016 /usr/bin/passwd

Set SUID bit

null@null-VirtualBox:~$ ls -l a.out
-rwxrwxr-x 1 null null 8600 Dec 27 16:00 a.out
null@null-VirtualBox:~$ chmod u+s a.out 
null@null-VirtualBox:~$ ls -l a.out 
-rwsrwxr-x 1 null null 8600 Dec 27 16:00 a.out
null@null-VirtualBox:~$ 

Unset SUID bit

$ chmod u-s a.out
